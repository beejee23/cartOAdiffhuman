__Overview:__ Multiple 3mm cartilage plugs of varying OA severity (ICRS grading system) were pulled from the tissue removed from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.  Samples were saturated in FITC and 3k Texas Red Dextran solutions and imaged using both FCS and RICS (Image correlation spectroscopy techniques) to quantify the diffusion coefficients of each molecule.  Samples were also characterized mechanically and chemically to yeild modulus, permeability, and compositional data.


__Hypothesis:__ The main hypothesis was that diffusivity would increase with OA severity.  We also are interested to see if we can detect changes in the mechanical and compositional properties that would be associated with diffusivity changes.

__End Goal:__ With arthroscopic microscopy instruments becoming more advanced, sophisticated imaging techiques like FCS and RICS could be used to identify OA before macrscopic damage occurs, by detecting sublte changes in the diffusivity of small molecules that would indicate alterations in the tissue matrix.
